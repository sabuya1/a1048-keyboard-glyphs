## Apple A1048 Keyboard Univers 57 Glyphs
original apple univers 57 extracted from a japanese apple manual pdf made in 2001.<br>
* in the svg file, the fonts on the right side are different from those on the left. I recreated them to my best ability (g, m, w, etc.)
* spacing/kerning has been set up in the font only for lowercase letters. The only capital letters with altered spacing is F for better printing of F keys.
* certain letters are missing that aren't present in the SVG. maybe one day I'll make those glyphs too :D

#### Example glyphs:

  The @, &, and $ symbols are different from the original univers 57 glyphs!
