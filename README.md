## Apple A1048 Keyboard Univers 48 Glyphs
original apple univers 57 extracted from a japanese apple manual pdf made in 2001.<br>
* in the svg file, the fonts on the right side are different from those on the left. I recreated them using the Univers 48 Condensed Oblique Font.
* the spacing between glyphs matches that of the Univers 48 Condensed Oblique font.


#### Example glyphs:

      alt="My Image"

  </div>
  The @, &, and $ symbols are different from the original univers 48 glyphs!
